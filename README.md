# PersianStemmingDataset
Persian Stemming data-set in order to evaluate new stemmers

There is no standard dataset for correctness evaluation of Persian stemming algorithms. In order to create a dataset for correctness evaluation of stemmers, we require a set of words with their stems. These datasets are automatically extracted from two manually stemmed corpora. The first dataset contains a collection of words and their stems, which has been extracted from the PerTreeBank corpus [1]. This corpus contains 4,689 distinct words. Moreover, in order to perform a better evaluation, we selected a large text corpus for the second dataset. The words and their stems of this dataset have been extracted from the Persian Dependency TreeBank corpus [2]. It contains 26,913 distinct words. These two datasets have good qualities in terms of the diversity of their Part-of-Speech tags.
